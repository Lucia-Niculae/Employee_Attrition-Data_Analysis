## Employee Attrition Project
### Python & Power BI

#### This repository is a Data Analysis project of a company which faces employee attrition. 
#### The data shows information on the employees who are either currently working within the company or have resigned. 
### The objective is to identify the factors which leeads to employee attrition.
#### Database source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/employee-attrition)

### I used Power BI to see the data better

### I used Python (Jupyter Notebook: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to understand the data better and get the information I nedeed.
#### I uploaded the entire Python analysis. Feel free to comment if you have improvments sugest.

##### Based on the available data, I created robot portraits for:
  - the employee in the Data Frame:
Married man that didn't leaved the company, travel rarely for business purpose, had studied the Life Science field, works in the Research & Development department, and that is in balance in terms of work and family life by not working over time.
  - the employee in the Data Frame who leaves the company:
Single man that travel rarely for business purposes, had studied the Life Science field, works in the Research & Development department and that works overtime.
  - employee who stays in the company:
Married man who rarely travel for business purpose, had studied the Life Science field, works in the Research & Development department, and that is in balance in terms of work and family life by not working over time.

##### General Conclusions by analysing the categorical variable:
•	Employees who remain in the company are the majority in the database (84% vs 16% who are under Attrition).
•	Most of the employee travel rarely for business purpose (71% vs 18,8% who are frequently traveling and 10,2% who are not traveling at all).
o	Most of the employee who left the company were traveling rarely for business purpose.
•	Most of the employee in the Data Frame are working in the Research & Development Department (65,4% vs 30,3% Sales and 4,3% HR) and they are also the one who are most under Attrition.
•	Most of the employee have Life Science as an Educational Field with a proportion of 41,2%, followed by Medical Field with 31,6%, Marketing 10,8%, Technical Degree 9%, Other 5,6% and HR 1,8%.
o	The same order is maintained when it comes to staff attrition.
•	The majority of the employee are Male with 60% of the total employee (40% female).
o	Males are also more under Attrition then Females.
•	Employees working as Sales Executives are more (22,2%), but employees working as Laboratory Technician leaves the job early. - Married employees are the majority in the database with 45,8% followed by single ones with 32% and divorced with 22,2%. - Contrary to expectations, the employees who leave the company are the unmarried ones.
•	The employee majority are not working OverTime. The employee who are leaving the company are the ones who work OverTime.
##### Conclusion:
•	The data can talk --> Most of the Employees:
o	have an above average education (3=Bachelor, 4=Master).
o	have rather a good Environment Satisfaction (3=High, 4=Very High).
o	are highly Job envolved (3=High)
o	have the lowest Job Level.
o	are rather satisfied with their work (3=High, 4=Very High)
o	All the company employees are performing very good (3=Excellent, 4=Outstanding)
o	are satisfied with their Job Relationships (3=High, 4=Very High)
o	do not own stocks in the company or they own only 1 stock in the company.
o	have spent in the last year 2 to 3 hours for training.
o	have above average WorkLifeBalance (3=Better).

##### Observation:
•	On average the employee are fine.
•	But let see who are the employee that are leaving the company
##### Conclusion:
•	Employees who have a low Environment Satisfaction, the lowest Job Level and who do not hold stocks in the company are under Attrition.
Conclusion: Numerical variables wrt to Attrition
•	Employees are leaving the company more:
o	around age 26 - 36.
o	when they already have experience in another company.
o	when the percent salary hike was the lowest in the company.
o	when they have little working experience, around 1 year of total working experience and also 1 year in the company.
•	In general employees are leaving after they have gained a little experience. The company seems to be the launch pad for young employees.
